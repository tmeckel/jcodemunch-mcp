## Cut code-reading token usage by **95% or more**

Most AI agents explore repositories the expensive way:

open entire files → skim thousands of irrelevant lines → repeat.

That is not “a little inefficient.”
That is a **token incinerator**.

**jCodeMunch indexes a codebase once and lets agents retrieve only the exact code they need**: functions, classes, methods, constants, outlines, and tightly scoped context bundles, with byte-level precision.

In retrieval-heavy workflows, that routinely cuts code-reading token usage by **95%+** because the agent stops brute-reading giant files just to find one useful implementation.

| Task                   | Traditional approach      | With jCodeMunch                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Find a function        | Open and scan large files | Search symbol → fetch exact implementation  |
| Understand a module    | Read broad file regions   | Pull only relevant symbols and imports      |
| Explore repo structure | Traverse file after file  | Query outlines, trees, and targeted bundles |

Index once. Query cheaply. Keep moving.
**Precision context beats brute-force context.**

**Stop paying your model to read the whole damn file.**

jCodeMunch turns repo exploration into **structured retrieval**.

Instead of forcing an agent to open giant files, wade through imports, boilerplate, comments, helpers, and unrelated code, jCodeMunch lets it navigate by **what the code is** and retrieve **only what matters**.

That means:

* **95%+ lower code-reading token usage** in many retrieval-heavy workflows 
* **less irrelevant context** polluting the prompt
* **faster repo exploration**
* **more accurate code lookup**
* **less repeated file-scanning nonsense**

It indexes your codebase once using tree-sitter, stores structured symbol metadata plus byte offsets into the original source, and retrieves exact implementations on demand instead of re-reading entire files over and over.

Recent releases have also made that retrieval workflow sharper and more useful in real engineering work, with BM25-based symbol search, context bundles, compact search modes, query suggestions for unfamiliar repos, dependency graphs, class hierarchy traversal, blast-radius analysis, multi-symbol bundles, live watch-based reindexing, automatic Claude Code worktree discovery (`watch-claude`), and benchmark reproducibility improvements.

## Real-world results

Independent 50-iteration A/B test on a real Vue 3 + Firebase production codebase — JCodeMunch vs native tools (Grep/Glob/Read), Claude Sonnet 4.6, fresh session per iteration:

| Metric | Native | JCodeMunch |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Success rate | 72% | **80%** |
| Timeout rate | 40% | **32%** |
| Mean cost/iteration | $0.783 | **$0.738** |
| Mean cache creation | 104,135 | **93,178 (−10.5%)** |

Tool-layer savings isolated from fixed overhead: **15–25%.** One finding category appeared exclusively in the JCodeMunch variant: orphaned file detection via `find_importers` — a structural query native tools cannot answer without scripting.

## Why agents need this

Most agents still inspect codebases like tourists trapped in an airport gift shop:

* open entire files to find one function
* re-read the same code repeatedly
* consume imports, boilerplate, and unrelated helpers
* burn context window on material they never needed in the first place

jCodeMunch fixes that by giving them a structured way to:

* search symbols by name, kind, or language
* inspect file and repo outlines before pulling source
* retrieve exact symbol implementations only
* grab a context bundle when surrounding imports matter
* fall back to text search when structure alone is not enough

Agents do not need bigger and bigger context windows.

They need **better aim**.

---

## What you get

### Symbol-level retrieval

Find and fetch functions, classes, methods, constants, and more without opening entire files.

### Faster repo understanding

Inspect repository structure and file outlines before asking for source.

### Lower token spend

Send the model the code it needs, not 1,500 lines of collateral damage.

### Structural queries native tools can't answer

`find_importers` tells you what imports a file. `get_blast_radius` tells you what breaks if you change a symbol. `get_class_hierarchy` traverses inheritance chains. These are not "faster grep" — they are questions grep cannot answer at all.

### Better engineering workflows

Useful for onboarding, debugging, refactoring, impact analysis, and exploring unfamiliar repos without brute-force file reading.

### Local-first speed

Indexes are stored locally for fast repeated access.

---

## How it works

jCodeMunch indexes local folders or GitHub repos, parses source with tree-sitter, extracts symbols, and stores structured metadata alongside raw file content in a local index. Each symbol includes enough information to be found cheaply and retrieved precisely later. 

That includes metadata like:

* signature
* kind
* qualified name
* one-line summary
* byte offsets into the original file

So when the agent wants a symbol, jCodeMunch can fetch the exact source directly instead of loading and rescanning the full file.

---

## Start fast

### 1. Install it

```bash
pip install jcodemunch-mcp
```

### 2. Add it to your MCP client

If you’re using Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add jcodemunch uvx jcodemunch-mcp
```

### 3. Tell your agent to actually use it

This matters more than people think.

Installing jCodeMunch makes the tools available. It does **not** guarantee the agent will stop its bad habit of brute-reading files unless you instruct it to prefer symbol search, outlines, and targeted retrieval. The changelog specifically calls out improved onboarding around this because it is a real source of confusion for first-time users. 

A simple instruction like this helps:

```markdown
Use jcodemunch-mcp for code lookup whenever available. Prefer symbol search, outlines, and targeted retrieval over reading full files.
```

> **Note:** For a comprehensive guide on enforcing these rules through agent hooks and prompt policies, see [AGENT_HOOKS.md](AGENT_HOOKS.md).

## Configuration

Settings are controlled by a JSONC config file (`config.jsonc`) with env var fallbacks for backward compatibility. Defaults are chosen so that a fresh install works without any configuration.

### Quick setup

```bash
jcodemunch-mcp config --init       # create ~/.code-index/config.jsonc from template
jcodemunch-mcp config              # show effective configuration
jcodemunch-mcp config --check      # validate config + verify prerequisites
```

`--check` validates that your config file is well-formed, your AI provider package is installed, your index storage path is writable, and HTTP transport packages are present. Exits non-zero on any failure — useful for CI/CD or first-run scripts.

### Config file locations

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Global | `~/.code-index/config.jsonc` | Server-wide defaults |
| Project | `{project_root}/.jcodemunch.jsonc` | Per-project overrides |

Project config merges over global config — closest to the work wins.

### Token-control levers (reduce schema tokens per turn)

| Config key | What it controls | Typical savings |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| `disabled_tools` | Remove tools from schema entirely | ~100–400 tokens/tool |
| `languages` | Shrink language enum + gate features | ~2–86 tokens/turn |
| `meta_fields` | Filter `_meta` response fields | ~50–150 tokens/call |
| `descriptions` | Control description verbosity | ~0–600 tokens/turn |

See the full template for all available keys. Run `jcodemunch-mcp config --init` to generate one.

### Deprecated env vars (v2.0 will remove)

The following env vars still work but are deprecated. Config file values take priority:

| Variable | Config key | Default |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `JCODEMUNCH_USE_AI_SUMMARIES` | `use_ai_summaries` | `true` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_TRUSTED_FOLDERS` | `trusted_folders` | `[]` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_MAX_FOLDER_FILES` | `max_folder_files` | `2000` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_MAX_INDEX_FILES` | `max_index_files` | `10000` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_STALENESS_DAYS` | `staleness_days` | `7` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_MAX_RESULTS` | `max_results` | `500` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_EXTRA_IGNORE_PATTERNS` | `extra_ignore_patterns` | `[]` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_CONTEXT_PROVIDERS` | `context_providers` | `true` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_REDACT_SOURCE_ROOT` | `redact_source_root` | `false` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_STATS_FILE_INTERVAL` | `stats_file_interval` | `3` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_SHARE_SAVINGS` | `share_savings` | `true` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_SUMMARIZER_CONCURRENCY` | `summarizer_concurrency` | `4` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_ALLOW_REMOTE_SUMMARIZER` | `allow_remote_summarizer` | `false` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_RATE_LIMIT` | `rate_limit` | `0` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_TRANSPORT` | `transport` | `stdio` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_HOST` | `host` | `127.0.0.1` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PORT` | `port` | `8901` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_LOG_LEVEL` | `log_level` | `WARNING` |

AI provider keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`, etc.) and `CODE_INDEX_PATH` are **always** read from env vars — they are never placed in config files.

AI provider priority: Anthropic → Gemini → local LLM → signature fallback. The first key that is set wins. `jcodemunch-mcp config` shows which provider is active.

## When does it help?

A common question: does this only help during exploration, or also when the agent is prompted to read a file before editing?

**It helps most when editing a specific function.** The "read before edit" constraint doesn't require reading the whole file — it requires reading the code. `get_symbol_source` gives you exactly the function body you're about to touch, nothing else. Instead of reading 700 lines to edit one method, you read those 30 lines.

| Scenario | Native tool | jCodemunch | Savings |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Edit one function (700-line file) | `Read` → 700 lines | `get_symbol_source` → 30 lines | ~95% |
| Understand a file's structure | `Read` → full content | `get_file_outline` → names + signatures | ~80% |
| Find which file to edit | `Grep` many files | `search_symbols` → exact match | comparable |
| Edit requires whole-file context | `Read` → full content | `get_file_content` → full content | ~0% |
| "What breaks if I change X?" | not possible | `get_blast_radius` | unique capability |

The cases where it doesn't help: edits that genuinely require understanding the entire file (restructuring file-level state, reordering logic that spans hundreds of lines). For those, `get_file_content` is roughly equivalent to `Read`. The cases where it helps most are targeted edits — one function, one method, one class — which is the majority of real editing work.

## Best for

* large repositories
* unfamiliar codebases
* agent-driven code exploration
* refactoring and impact analysis
* teams trying to cut AI token costs without making agents dumber
* developers who are tired of paying premium rates for glorified file scrolling

## New here?

Start with **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** for the fastest setup path.

Then index a repo, ask your agent what it has indexed, and have it retrieve code by symbol instead of reading entire files. That is where the savings start.
